//Question 5
//What will be returned if you look for the index of something that does not exist?


Answer-
let exampleArray = [1,'tiger',lion,4,5]
    
console.log(exampleArray.indexOf("elephant"));

//IndexOf() returns 0 â€” because the substring undefined is found at position 0 in the string undefined.
